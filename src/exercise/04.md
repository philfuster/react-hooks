# useState: tic tac toe

## üìù Your Notes

- **Managed State**: State that you need to explicitly manage
- **Derived State**: State that you can calculate based on other state

Prefer derived state over managed state where applicable because it reduces
complexity. Even if the computation is expensive, it is possible to increase
performance using `useMemo`.

In React, it's bad practice to mutate state that's already being managed by
React. For example, if you are maintaining an array of data in React, when you
have to update it, instead of mutating the current React state, you should make
a copy of the data, ex. `const stateCopy = [...state]` then make mutations to
`stateCopy`, since it isn't being managed by React yet, then
`setState(stateCopy)`, to update the React managed state. This will prevent
weird bugs from happening due to mutating existing state.

Storing the `squares` array in local storage allows for users to come back to
their precious tick-tac-toe game later on.

`React.useEffect` is perfect for this use case because updating localStorage is
outside of updating state. It's syncing local state with some external source.

`React.useEffect` is better for syncing state with the outside world because it
ensures the side effects are handled consistently and declaratively. It also
separates the concerns of updating local state from the logic for performing
side effects. `useEffect` also ensures that side effects run consistently after
every render when dependencies change. This avoids potential bus where side
effects might not run as expected if embedded directly in state update
functions.

React also encourages a declarative programming style. Using `useEffect` aligns
with this approach by declaring what side effects should happen based on the
component's state and props.

Whenever you find yourself needing to perform an operation that affects
something outside of the component's scope based on state or props changes,
`React.useEffect` should be used.

**Note**: Keep in mind since `squares` is an array, it must be serialized before
it can be stored in local storage. And when it's retrieved from local storage,
it's needs to be deserialized because local storage stores things as strings.

## Background

A `name` is one thing, but a real UI is a bit different. Often you need more
than one element of state in your component, so you'll call `React.useState`
more than once. Please note that each call to `React.useState` in a given
component will give you a unique state and updater function.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/04.js)
- [Final](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.js)

We're going to build tic-tac-toe (with localStorage support)! If you've gone
through React's official tutorial, this was lifted from that.

You're going to need some managed state and some derived state:

- **Managed State:** State that you need to explicitly manage
- **Derived State:** State that you can calculate based on other state

`squares` is the managed state and it's the state of the board in a
single-dimensional array:

```
[
  'X', 'O', 'X',
  'X', 'O', 'O',
  'X', 'X', 'O'
]
```

This will start out as an empty array because it's the start of the game.

`nextValue` will be either the string `X` or `O` and is derived state which you
can determine based on the value of `squares`. We can determine whose turn it is
based on how many "X" and "O" squares there are. We've written this out for you
in a `calculateNextValue` function at the bottom of the file.

`winner` will be either the string `X` or `O` and is derived state which can
also be determined based on the value of `squares` and we've provided a
`calculateWinner` function you can use to get that value.

### Alternate

If you'd prefer to practice refactoring a class that does this to a hook, then
you can open `src/exercise/04-classes.js` and open that on
[an isolated page](http://localhost:3000/isolated/exercise/04-classes.js) to
practice that.

## Extra Credit

### 1. üíØ preserve state in localStorage

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-1.js)

üë®‚Äçüíº Our customers want to be able to pause a game, close the tab, and then resume
the game later. Can you store the game's state in `localStorage`?

### 2. üíØ useLocalStorageState

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-2.js)

It's cool that we can get localStorage support with a simple `useEffect`, but
it'd be even cooler to use the `useLocalStorageState` hook that's already
written for us in `src/utils.js`!

Refactor your code to use that custom hook instead. (This should be a pretty
quick extra credit).

### 3. üíØ add game history feature

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/04.extra-3.js)

Open
[http://localhost:3000/isolated/final/04.extra-3.js](http://localhost:3000/isolated/final/04.extra-3.js)
and see that the extra version supports keeping a history of the game and allows
you to go backward and forward in time. See if you can implement that!

NOTE: This extra credit is one of the harder extra credits. Don't worry if you
struggle on it!

üí∞ Tip, in the final example, we store the history of squares in an array of
arrays. `[[/* step 0 squares */], [/* step 1 squares */], ...etc]`, so we have
two states: `history` and `currentStep`.

üí∞ Tip, in the final example, we move the state management from the `Board`
component to the `Game` component and that helps a bit. Here's what the JSX
returned from the `Game` component is in the final version:

```javascript
return (
  <div className="game">
    <div className="game-board">
      <Board onClick={selectSquare} squares={currentSquares} />
      <button className="restart" onClick={restart}>
        restart
      </button>
    </div>
    <div className="game-info">
      <div>{status}</div>
      <ol>{moves}</ol>
    </div>
  </div>
)
```
